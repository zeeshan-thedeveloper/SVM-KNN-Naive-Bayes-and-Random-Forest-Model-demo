## Description

The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive guide to implementing and understanding different machine learning algorithms, such as SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, for various classification tasks. It includes Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate the following:

- Building and training SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest models from scratch.
- Fine-tuning these models for specific tasks.
- Evaluating model performance on benchmark datasets.
